## What does it do?

This package adds a new `php artisan make:service {name} {--noContract}` command. It will create a service file and its contract (interface) for saving time while working with Laravel Framework.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require nordcoders/laravel-service-maker
```

## How does it work?

After installation, the command `php artisan make:service {name} {--noContract}` will be available.

### Create services files

For example, the command `php artisan make:service createUser` will generate a service file `CreateUserService.php` located in `app/Services/CreateUser`.

It will also generate an interface (contract) called `CreateUserContract.php` located in `app/Services/Contracts`.

Adding a ```--noContract``` option will prevent the service from implementing any contract and will not create any contract file.

### Create services for models

Adding a ```--service``` or ```-S``` option is available when creating a model.

For example, the command `php artisan make:model Book --service` or `php artisan make:model Book -S` will generate a model with service too.

The commande `php artisan make:model Book --all` or `php artisan make:model Book -a` will also geenrate a model, migration, factory, seeder, policy, controller, form requests and service.

Adding a ```--noContract``` or ```-N``` option will prevent the model service from implementing any contract and will not create any contract file.

### Contracts

If you never need any contracts. Then turn the **with_interface** value to false in the config file.

## Configuration file

You can publish the config file with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag="service-maker-config"
```

This is the content of the published config file:

```php
return [
    'with_interface' => true,
];
```
